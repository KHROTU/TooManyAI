# SnakeAI: Exploring AI Implementations in the Classic Snake Game

## Project Overview

This project explores various artificial intelligence (AI) implementations in the classic Snake game. It showcases different AI algorithms and approaches using C++ and Python. The goal is to provide a platform for experimenting with and comparing different AI techniques in a simple, yet engaging environment.

## Implementations

### CppSnakeAI

- **Description:** This implementation is written in C++.
- **Status:** Incomplete. Further development is not currently planned.
- **Note:** This implementation serves as a starting point and may not be fully functional.

### PySnakeAI

- **Description:** This implementation uses a simple A* algorithm for pathfinding. While not a true AI in the traditional sense, it provides a functional solution for the Snake game.
- **Status:** Complete.
- **Dependencies:** Python
- **Instructions:**
  1. Ensure you have Python installed.
  2. Navigate to the `PySnakeAI/` directory in your terminal.
  3. Run `python Snake.py`.
- **Details:** This implementation provides a basic AI for the Snake game, demonstrating pathfinding principles.

### PySnakeAI+

- **Description:** This implementation utilizes Deep Q-Networks (DQN) with PyTorch, representing the most advanced AI implementation in the project.
- **Status:** Under Development.
- **Dependencies:** Python, PyTorch (recommended installation via Anaconda in a virtual environment)
- **Instructions:**
  1. Ensure you have Python and PyTorch installed. If you are not familiar with PyTorch, it is recommended to use Anaconda and install PyTorch in a virtual environment.
  2. Navigate to the `PySnakeAI+/` directory in your terminal.
  3. Run `python SnakePlus.py`.
- **Details:** This implementation explores the use of deep reinforcement learning to train an AI to play the Snake game.

## Future Work

- Further development and refinement of the DQN implementation in `PySnakeAI+`, including hyperparameter tuning and exploration of different network architectures.
- Potential exploration of other AI algorithms and techniques for the Snake game, such as genetic algorithms or Monte Carlo tree search.
- Creation of a comprehensive evaluation framework to compare the performance of different AI implementations.
- Adding unit tests to ensure code quality and prevent regressions.
